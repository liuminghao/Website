For your own safety, we suggest you to do the following things:</p> <ol> <li>For each tutoring session, only meet in public locations such as libraries or dining halls, especially if it is your first time meeting this user. Let your friends know that you are meeting this person at this location. </li> <li>You should always review usersâ€™ rating, which could reflect their quality and ensure your safety. </li> <li>At each session, always verify the other user with his/her profile picture provided, for there is a possibility of his/her account being hacked and used by an identity theft.</li> <li>Stop communicating with users who pressured you for personal information, such as your last name, credit card number, date of birth, etc. Other users should not need any additional information from you other than specific academic questions in preparation for the session.</li> <li>Leave the session immediately when the other user does something that threatens you and call the police if necessary. Do not worry about being overcharged, for you can always file a report to Helpers for a price dispute. Your safety is our priority. </li> </ol> </div> <hr> </div>
