			<div class="content">Helpers was founded by four students at Boston College. Our founding philosophy was to 
				design an efficient platform where students can provide academic support to their peers.
				Our application helps students find tutors, and moreover it allows students to become
				tutors themselves. To accomplish our goal, we developed an application that matches
				tutors and students instantly based on several criterion.

			<h2 class="subtitle centered">Our Vision</h2>
		  	<div class="content">As we reviewed for finals last year, we had many last-minute questions which could not be
				answered as professors were not holding office hours and the school’s learning center was
				closed. We hoped that we could find someone to answer our questions at any time we
				wished. The ideal situation we had in mind was discovering that the person who sat next to
				you at the library could answer your questions as he took a study break. We also thought it
				would be helpful to earn spending money by answering others’ questions as they studied
				for their finals. Therefore, we decided to make this dream come true by creating an
				application that instantly matches the academic needs among students. We hope to make
				students’ “tutoring” and “being tutored” experiences as smooth as possible so “tutoring” no
				longer is a serious and formal teaching session but a casual intellectual conversation among students.
